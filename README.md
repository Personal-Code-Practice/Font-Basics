# Font-Basics

Challenge: To replace the yellow 20px Comic Sans font for all elements but without simply relying on browser defaults. You'll need to use two webfonts from Google. You can use CSS to set the font of your page to any font that the user's computer already has installed. Some fonts are considered “web safe fonts” (for example, Arial, Helvetica, and Georgia), because the vast majority of computers have them installed by default. But designers don’t want to limit themselves to the handful of web safe fonts. To use any font beyond web safe fonts, you have to use Webfonts. Webfonts are fonts that you load in the browser using HTML, and then can reference in your CSS. Google provides a set of webfonts that you can use for free (there are many places to buy webfont licenses as well). You'll need to select one font family for the H1 and H2 elements, and another as the default for the page (consider targeting the body element for this purpose).
